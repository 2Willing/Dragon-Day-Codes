The codes under this directory are used to generate the panels in Figure 5.

'draw_cor2.py','draw_hi1.py','draw_hi2_earth.py' are used to plot panels (a)--(d), i.e., the white-light images of the interplanetary propagation of the CME.

'draw_composite.py' is used to plot the composite maps of cor2, HI1 and HI2.

'draw_composite_only_hi1.py' is used to plot the composite maps of cor2 and HI1.

'pyslit_hi12.py' uses the composite maps generated by 'draw_composite.py' to plot the time-elongation map of the whole interplanetary propagation of the CME, as shown in panel (g).

'pyslit_only_hi1.py' uses the composite maps generated by 'draw_composite_only_hi1.py' to plot the time-elongation map presenting the interaction of the two CMEs, as shown in panel (f).

To generate the panel (h), one should replace the '__init__.py' in the local SolarMACH installation directory with the '__init__.py' presented in this directory, and run 'solarmach_0321.py'
