The codes in this directory is used to generate the intensity and base-difference maps in Figure 2.

If the variable 'rd' in the code is set to 1, then it will produce base-difference maps, otherwise it will produce intensity maps.

Variable 'time_exp' in the code represents the time of the image you wish to make.

The 'wvl' variable is a string of the AIA wavelength passband you wish to make images of. e.g., '304' means 304 Angstrom band.

The codes should be located in the same directory where a series of AIA maps downloaded from http://jsoc.stanford.edu exist. If you want to make exactly the same images as Figure 2, the series must be started with the fits files at around 16:00 UT, March 19th.

The paths of EUI, EUVI, XRT images should be modified according to your own paths.
