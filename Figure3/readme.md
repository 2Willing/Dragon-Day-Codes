The gui.py code is mainly from the gcs_python code (https://github.com/johan12345/gcs_python?tab=readme-ov-file), written by Johan L. Freiherr von Forstner.

To run this code, please install the gcs_python python package first, and replace the gui.py in the gcs_python package directory with the gui.py presented here.

The "sohomap2" and "stamap2" variables should be filled by the path to the c2/c3 image and cor2 image of the modeling time, respectively.

The "sohomap1" and "stamap1" variables should be changed to the path of the c2/c3 image and cor2 image before the running-difference interval, respectively.

Then please follow the steps in https://github.com/johan12345/gcs_python?tab=readme-ov-file to run the gcs_python module. Modify the GCS model parameters with the parameters presented in the Method section, in the opened GUI.
